# privacy-preserve-dao-voting

This repository contains the implementation of the paper:  
 ðŸ“„ [S2DV: Scalable and Secure DAO Voting](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/284) 

A privacy-preserving DAO voting system that leverages homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to ensure secure, verifiable, and anonymous voting while maintaining voter transparency and integrity.  

This repository offers two different systems using ZKPs:
1. One based on Bulletproof and Sigma protocols.
2. Another based on Groth16.
