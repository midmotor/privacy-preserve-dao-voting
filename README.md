# privacy-preserve-dao-voting
A privacy-preserving DAO voting system that leverages homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to ensure secure, verifiable, and anonymous voting while maintaining voter transparency and integrity.  

This repository offers two different systems using ZKPs:
1. One based on Bulletproof and Sigma protocols.
2. Another based on Groth16.

## TODO List

- Create a benchmark for Groth16.
- Provide performance results for both ZKP systems.
